# wd-editor

> This is rich text editor based on vue.js. There are so many editor already exists in the world. And why I rebuild a editor?  The following reasons:
1. Most existing Editor base on Jquery.js or original javascript . And that function is simple as well as not enough flexibility.
2. 
## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
